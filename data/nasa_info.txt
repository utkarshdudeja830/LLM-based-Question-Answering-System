Voyager Space Missions (NASA)

Introduction
The Voyager program is a NASA mission that launched two robotic probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, in 1977 to explore the outer planets of the solar system and eventually interstellar space. They remain among the most iconic missions in space exploration.

Mission Goals
Voyager’s primary mission was to study the outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The mission included flybys, close-up imaging, and measurement of planetary atmospheres, magnetic fields, and moons.

Voyager 1 Highlights
- Launched: September 5, 1977
- First spacecraft to enter interstellar space (2012)
- Closest approach to Jupiter: 1979
- Discovered volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io
- Took the famous "Pale Blue Dot" photo of Earth from 6 billion kilometers away

Voyager 2 Highlights
- Launched: August 20, 1977
- Only spacecraft to visit Uranus and Neptune
- Discovered 10 new moons, two new rings, and magnetic field data
- Crossed into interstellar space in 2018

Golden Record
Each Voyager carries a 12-inch gold-plated phonograph record containing sounds and images from Earth, intended as a message to any extraterrestrial life. It includes:
- Greetings in 55 languages
- Music (Bach, Beethoven, Chuck Berry)
- Earth sounds: wind, thunder, animals

Current Status
- Both Voyager probes are still communicating with NASA.
- They are over 20 billion km from Earth.
- Power is declining; instruments are being turned off one by one.
- Expected to continue transmitting data until around 2025–2030.
